WHAT IS IT?
===========

Just a very basic IRC bot for funz, And as a potential replacement for the
[SparkBot](https://github.com/JoshAshby/supybot-plugins) currently living
in #sparkfun. This is currently very heavily based off the gevent bot found
[here](https://gist.github.com/maxcountryman/676306) but this is probably
subject to change at anytime.
